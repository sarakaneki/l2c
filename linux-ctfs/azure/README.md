# Linux Command Line CTF Lab - Azure

Welcome to the Linux Command Line Capture The Flag (CTF) lab on Microsoft Azure! This project sets up a learning environment where you can practice your Linux command line skills by solving various challenges.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your local machine:

1. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) (version 1.9.0 or later)
2. [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
3. An Azure account with an active subscription

## How much it's going to cost

If you leave this lab running, it's going to cost you $8/month, as it is running `Standard B1s` VM in Azure. Use the `terraform destroy` command to clean resources, once completed with CTFs.

> [!NOTE]  
> You might encounter an error, if your Azure account is a Student account, please look at [this work aroud.](https://github.com/g-now-zero/l2c-guides/blob/main/posts/ctf-azure-spot-instances-guide.md)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and access your CTF lab environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/learntocloud/ltc-linux-challenge
    cd ltc-linux-challenge/azure
    ```

2. Log in to Azure using the Azure CLI:

    ``` sh
    az login
    ```

3. Initialize Terraform:

    ``` sh
    terraform init
    ```

4. Apply the Terraform configuration:

    ``` sh
    terraform apply \
    -var az_region="YOUR_AZURE_REGION" \
    -var subscription_id="YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_AZURE_REGION` with Azure Region and `YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with Azure Subscription that you want to use, by default it uses East US.

   When prompted, type `yes` to confirm.

5. After the apply completes, note the `public_ip_address` output. You'll use this to connect to your lab environment.

## Accessing the Lab Environment

To access your lab environment:

1. Use SSH to connect to the Azure VM as the CTF user:

    ``` sh
    ssh ctf_user@<public_ip_address>
    ```

2. When prompted for a password, enter: `CTFpassword123!`
3. Once logged in, you'll see a welcome message with instructions for your first challenge.

## Cleaning Up

When you're done with the lab, don't forget to destroy the Azure resources to avoid unnecessary charges:

`terraform destroy`

Type `yes` when prompted to confirm.

## Security Note

This lab is designed for learning purposes and uses a password-based login for simplicity. In real-world scenarios, key-based authentication is recommended for better security.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your Azure CLI is correctly configured with your credentials.
2. Check that you're using a compatible Terraform version.
3. Verify that you have the necessary Azure permissions to create the required resources.

If problems persist, please open an issue in this repository.

Happy learning, and good luck with your CTF challenges!
